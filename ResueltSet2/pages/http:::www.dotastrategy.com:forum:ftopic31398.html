			Welcome to my number 76 hero analysis post which are located exclusively on Dotastrategy.com in the Heroes Forum.  Today’s hero comes via special request of me, Ghoster88.  Please focus on the hero’s abilities in your experience.  Competitive vs Pub doesn’t matter, it’s just about the hero.  All of the Analysis can be found in the Data Base which is located in The Library, or click the link located here.  <a href="http://www.dotastrategy.com/forum/ftopic30529" target="_blank" >Hero Database</a> 
<br />
 
<br />
 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Rooftrellen the Treant Protector</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
Let’s start with his role and his stats.  Rooftrellen is a support ganker.  His aoe ultimate lends his skills to an initiator as well.
<br />

<br />
Stat Analysis
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Strength=25+2.8</span> His starting STR is great and the growth is very good.  Sadly, he used to have the highest growth in the game at 3.4, but thanks to Icefrog he no longer does.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Agility=15+2</span>  The starting AGI is pretty poor but the growth is pretty solid.  He only has 1 starting armor though.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Intelligence=17+1.8</span> Bad starting INT and a mediocre growth do little to ease his mana burdens.
<br />

<br />
Skill Analysis (Note: Abilities are discussed about their maximum level, unless stated otherwise.)
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nature’s Guise
<br />

<br />
The good-</span>  Rooftrellen shrouds himself in the deep leaves of the forest.  Nature’s Guise will turn the target invisible for a whopping 60 seconds, provided they stay within a generous 375 aoe of a tree.  The cd on this move is very short at 4 sec and the mana cost is only 60.  This can be cast on any ally so Roof can cloak his entire team fairly easily and fairly quickly.  Roof can also cast spells under Nature’s Guise without breaking the invisibility.  Thematically this move is awesome.  The idea of vines and branches covering up your friends to hide them from danger is awesome.  As a final bonus, an ally blessed with the Guise will receive a 10% ms increase.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The bad-</span> As stated earlier an ally will need to remain within distance of a tree to stay invisible.  Despite all the trees on the map, it’s surprising how often this can be an issue.  Another big issue is that there is a 2 sec fade time on the cloak, so you’ll be in danger while fading.  Also, the cast range is only 300 so Roof has to be pretty close to a target to cloak them.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Leech Seed
<br />

<br />
The good-</span>  Roof throws a Pokeball at his enemies.  Bulbasaur pops out and tags one foe with his patented Leech Seed.  The enemy will be slowed by 24% for the next 3 sec.  During those 3 sec, they will take 300 damage, divided into 4 pulses of 75 damage a piece.  The interesting part is that just like the Pokemon move, those pulses will also heal Roof and any allied heroes or creeps by the same amount.  The heal aoe is 500.  It’s a good ganking tool, and it’s a great way to get health back while assaulting your foes.  The cd is pretty reasonable at 12 sec too.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The bad-</span>   I don’t know what it is about slows, but this one often seems negligible.  It’s definitely there, but it never seems to slow them as much as the number indicates it would.  The mana cost is a brutal 140, even at level 1 which is retarded.  Also, the heal/damage is over time, not instant.  The cast range is 350 so again, Roof will have to be fairly close to tag someone with this.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Living Armor
<br />

<br />
The good-</span>  It’s a passive meaning it’s a relief for your mana pool.  Huzzah.  Roof will give any allied heroes in a 900 aoe 4 armor as well as 4 HP regen per sec.  This also works on towers which is pretty handy.  As a very nice bonus, the aura will be global for your allies during the daytime.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The bad-</span>  No flaws on this move.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overgrowth
<br />

<br />
The good-</span>  Rooftrellen summons the Earth to do his bidding.  Vines will sprout from the ground and ensare all enemies around Roof.  The aoe is 625 around Roof.  Enemies will be ensared for 3 sec.  They won’t be able to move, attack, or cast the blink spell while held.  They will also take 100 damage per sec resulting in 300 total.  The mana cost is fairly cheap for a move like this at 200.  The cd is also 95 sec, which again, is pretty good for an aoe ultimate hold like this.  In a very strange twist, the vines will also go through Magic Immunity and hold the target.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The bad-</span>  In the second part of that strange twist, enemies who become Magic Immune after being ensnared will be free.  So if you get caught, and hit MI, you’ll be free, but if you use MI, then get caught, you are stuck.  It’s nice that Roof has a way to get around MI, but this seems needlessly inconsistent.  Either it should totally goes through MI, or it doesn’t.  Also(thanks to some recent nerfs) the DPS is pretty bad, especially the earlier levels( a pathetic 150 damage at level 1).  300 total damage for a level 3 ult like this is just sad.  The worst part of Overgrowth is that it does not stop your opponents from casting spells.  Casters can fully wreak havoc on you.  It’s obnoxious.  Overgrowth is also absurdly easy to counter.  Any illusion creator or any fool with that dumb item Manta Style can simply pop out of the branches.   
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overview-</span> By the time I post this, Rooftrellen will have been altered in some way.  Since I’ve been playing the game, he’s gone through about 4 or 5 reworks.  He used to put wisps in trees to spy, then he created trees to spy, then he made owls to spy, now he doesn’t like to spy, cause it hurts his eye, cause he’s a gentle guy, so he saps health now.  So forgive me if this analysis is obsolete once he is changed for the umpteenth time.  Although regarding his most recent change, Rooftrellen is the most overpowered thing since sliced bread.  Did you know that?  I sure as hell didn’t.  This hero has received nerf, after nerf, after nerf.  I didn’t think he was all that powerful to begin with but apparently, he pissed off IceFrog.  Rooftrellen use to be a lot of fun.  He used to be a crazy tank because of how hard it was to get rid of him.  He had the highest STR growth in the game, he had crazy armor properties, he hit fairly darn hard because of all that Strength.  Now he is a sad pathetic shell of his former self.  He almost has no identity because he’s been altered and changed so much at this point.  I don’t know what his pub/comp popularity is but I can tell you for me personally I hate playing him now.  I use to love him, particularly with the old Eyes in the Forest set up.  Even his Sentinel set up was neat.  And honestly I liked the simplicity of the Leech Seed set up as well but it instantly stopped being fun when he got nerfed into the ground.  Personally, I can’t think of a single time when you should pick Roof over another hero of his type.  His ult is far too easy to counter and since it no longer lasts 5 sec, it pales compared to Ravage or Black Hole.  It’s so obnoxious to trap a team in Overgrowth, only to have 2 heroes pop BKB’s, two more cast stuns, and the last one hits their manta and look at that!  Everyone is free.  Now, Roof is definitely not useless.  Leech Seed is a good ganking/healing tool.  Nature’s Guise can be obnoxious to your enemies.  Living Armor can be a great early game assist to your team(though it was horribly overrated, thus getting it nerfed).  And Overgrowth can be ok, depending on the team you are fighting.  Though he’s a shell of his former tanking self, Roof can still soak up a bit of damage.  He can have some mana issues, but for the most part, his needs can be met fairly easily.  But I really miss when this guy was awesome.  Right now, he just makes me sad.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Response</span>
<br />
Feel free to share your thoughts on Roof, line-ups you find him to be very strong in, and why you agree or disagree with my thoughts.  And of course, the big obvious question, What is your favorite version of Rooftrellen?  Personally I liked the old Eyes in the Forest version.  The one where you put the wisps on the trees.  Planting the trees themselves was equally nice.  If you would like to see a certain hero looked at, let me know.  Thanks for reading!
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Verdict-
<br />

<br />
Need=</span> Roof’s newest version was debuted in 6.72.  We are currently on 6.74.  This is every single nerf he received in that short time span.
<br />

<br />
-Armor reduced by 1
<br />
-Nature’s Guise cooldown increased from 3 seconds to 10/8/6/4 sec
<br />
-Leech Seed cooldown rescaled from 12 to 18/16/14/12 sec
<br />
-Living Armor now regenerates buildings only in a 900 aoe.
<br />
-Base armor reduced by 1, AGAIN!
<br />
-Added 2 second fade time to Nature’s Guise
<br />
-Overgrowth AOE reduced from 725 to 625
<br />
-Living Armor regeneration reduced from 2/3/4/5 to 1/2/3/4
<br />
-Strength from 27+3.4 to 25+2.8
<br />
-Overgrowth cooldown increased from 100/95/90 to 115/105/95
<br />
-Overgrowth damage per second decreased from 70/100/130 to 50/75/100
<br />
-Leech Seed manacost increased from 110/120/130/140 to 140.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I want every single one of those reverted.  The only one that even made the slightest sense, was taking away the Global Tower Regen.
<br />

			Wow after all these months you're still persevering, kudos to you my friend <img src="images/smiles/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I agree with you on everything. Roof seems so weak and boring to play nowadays. However its funny to see that roof's winrate in dota 2 is amongst the highest, at around 58%, its insane!
<br />

<br />
Before 6.72, roof's ulti was 5 seconds at level 1 (if i remember correctly). So damn strong, it was basically a guaranteed double kill at level 6 if you landed it on two people with an ally present. I really miss those sentinels, so fun to play! <img src="images/smiles/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"></span><br/><br/>

			Maybe you're playing against NS at night and that's why the slow doesn't seem to work. Seed and Soul Ring early on allows tower diving, making pushing and killing a lot easier.
<br />

<br />
1 flaw the Living Armor does is it sucks on night. So if you're facing Nightstalker, you're going to have a bad time.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.nodiatis.com/personality.htm" target="_blank" ><p style="width: 500px; overflow: hidden;"><img src="http://www.nodiatis.com/pub/18.jpg" style="border: 0;" onLoad="if(this.width > 500) {this.width = 500;}" onmouseout="nd();" onmouseover="if(this.width == 500) {return overlib('<img src=templates/Raid/images/resized-image.gif>', ol_fgcolor='', ol_bgcolor='', ol_width=147, ol_offsetx=22, ol_offsety=-7, CAPTION, '');}" onclick="if(this.width == 500) { window.open('templates/Raid/resizefix.php?originalsize=http://www.nodiatis.com/pub/18.jpg', '_blank' , 'scrollbars=1, toolbar=no, resizable=1, menubar=no, directories=no, status=yes'); return false; }" /></p></a>

			@ghoster88, Lol for the Eye Spy reference.
<br />
@topic, I have never seen him used in comp, but I like the old Living Armor that looked like you had vines growing out of your head when cast on a hero. I never knew all those Pokemon DotA hero ideas finally took their toll on Icefrog resulting in the creation/copy of Leech Seed. Forest Sentinel Owl Scout thingy was a better spell.

			Wanna know the reason behind his nerfs?
<br />

<br />
Have you ever met a hero that can farm as effectively as him, survive as effectively as him, dive as effectively as him, be a babysitting-gankink-tanking-semicarry?No?Then you never played Roof.
<br />

<br />
His problem was that he's simply alltogether perfectly rounded and can do amaizing shit with just the smallest of farm. Still, he can farm the living daylights out of you and overthrow you. Has a gamebraker ultimate, team conceal that is just darn annoying with another move that heals the entire team(if you play your cards well), can still tank, can still dishout damage. So in conclusion we have a hero with:
<br />

<br />
-Damage
<br />
-Tankiness
<br />
-Crowd Control(stuns slows etcetera)
<br />
-Ability to Farm
<br />
-Lanestaying
<br />
-Escape
<br />
-Potential
<br />

<br />

			For me, I don't need every single nerf to be reverted. That would make him slightly imba. Str growth is fine, 2 second fade time is fine, global regen tower is fine. I think we need buff in: armor increase by 1 and increase DoT in Overgrowth. 100/125/150 damage seems balanced.
<br />

<br />
Who needs free ward anyway? His invi skill allows u to scout enemy's jungle, like u do when u r playing riki. And its 60 second duration which is long.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"></span><br/><br/>

			Global heal wasn't enough for you??
<br />
The slow is too much, and his sustain is too good.
<br />
At lvl 6 having as much dmg as a lion was wrong. So the ult needed a nerf.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I'm guessing u never laned against someone who had a roof maxing the aura before. It was just.... They had a free RoH ffs.
<br />
I honestly don't get icefrog anymore. TB was solid and got changed to something annoying, op early, and terribad lategame.(Funny part is that he was supposed to be a carry)
<br />
And roof got changed a million times. Now into this monstrousity. He has dmg, global sustain, huge aoe disable, team invisibility...
<br />

<br />
@ranged
<br />

<br />
Really? U want a buff to the ult dmg?
<br />
And who needs free wards??? Who says that???
<br />
Free maphack is awesome.they gave a team an upperhand in positioning<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br />_________________<br />read what the penguin in the avatar says,

<br />
wards are supposed to ward off ganks
<br />

<br />
you dont know how disappointing and draining a failed gank can be.
<br />

<br />
you probably don't buy wards yourself.
<br />

<br />
They're basically there so your hero won't need to see things by going there. (example: rune whoring) You think Treant can rune-whore with his invi skill?
<br />

<br />
Invi &lt; Gem/Dust/Necromonicon
<br />

<br />
Wards of treant before &lt; Axes/Tango

			Yeah, if every1 like wards then explain to me why icefrog remove 'ward' skill on him?
<br />

<br />
I don't know about wards? Why is every1 think I'm a noob? I'm an experienced player. Don't lecture me about that!
<br />

<br />
The reason why I said that because Nature Guise is somehow good enough to scout. Icefrog made 60s invi in exchange of ward. You probably don't know what perma-invi on riki for. That's basically the same method as Nature Guise.
<br />

<br />
Invi can be countered by dust or gem or blabla.. And u think ward can't be countered as well? His ward can also be countered by the same items.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying ward is useless. I'm saying that nature guise also as useful as ward skill.
<br />

<br />
@neimi
<br />
Yeah, I want to buff his dps for ulti. You got a problem with that? Or u think that is too imba? I just wish to buff only at dmg ulti. Its MUCH better than reverting every single nerf Icefrog changed.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"></span><br/><br/>

			i think he's a bit overrated... the invi isn't a useful escape tool if you dont know abou the 2 sec fade time(honestly I fed because of that) and everybody is talking about team invi when in fact he doesn't have the mana to sustain it and the slow is unreliable that I wouldn't mind if he removes it... he's commonly picked for his ulti which is strong but kinda low on AoE and dmg... there are other heroes who can set better than him namely TH and SK whose disables are more reliable... and wtf if you just use him as a babysitter then you would get low levels on him which means he wouldn't be able to semi carry(which I think is weaker and more impractical than a semi carry vs) lategame if you won't give him farm time to recover in midgame which is contradictory to his ganking-teamfight playstyle... anyway, if you guys will ask me who support to pick i'd rather choose to play maiden(the no aura style, one must not pick her simply because of the passive... she has strong disable and powerful AoE ult for such a support) or ogre or SD but not roof...
<br />
I like the roof with the wards better... if you guys dont like it cause its imba you're just too lay to cut the tree(the oldest version)...-_-
<br />
the only thing that is 'imba' on him is his regenerative abilities... if  your DK is on mid and your roof is maxing out the passive first im pretty sure the enemy mid will have a very very hard time...<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br />_________________<br />Are we borne to die?
