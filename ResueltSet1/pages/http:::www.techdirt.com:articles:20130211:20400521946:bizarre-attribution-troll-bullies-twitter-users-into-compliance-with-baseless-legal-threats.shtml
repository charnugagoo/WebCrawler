<h1>Bizarre &#39;Attribution&#39; Troll Bullies Twitter Users Into Compliance With Baseless Legal Threats</h1><h3>from the <i>tongue-not-made-of-glass</i> dept</h3><div>My apologies ahead of time for the length of this piece, but anything shorter wouldn't do the subject justice. I will, however, provide plenty of pictures and blockquotes. This post deals with a strange copyright troll, which bullies people into properly attributing a quoted poem. The troll runs across multiple social media platforms but does a bulk of its "work" at Twitter, where it can receive instantaneous feedback. Along the way, we'll deal with the poet himself, a company called On Press Inc. and some other connections which seem to indicate the poet himself is behind the trolling, along with a threatened lawsuit against me for copyright infringement, defamation and false claims.
<br /><br />
It starts out simply enough. As a contributor to this site, I was doing the sort of thing we do in our downtime -- running a Twitter search for the term "infringement." The search results were dominated by tweets from an account that looked exactly like this one.
<br />
<center><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/47yntfr.png" style="width: 500px; height: 304px;" /></center>
<p>
Only it wasn't this one. The account I saw had this name: <a href="http://twitter.com/xsaonpress" target="_blank">@xsaonpress</a>.</p>
<p>
When I returned the next day, I was greeted with the message that the above account had been suspended. Odd. So, I searched again, only this time using the keywords "tongues" and "glass," -- two words in the title of the poem in question -- and found that On Press was still in business.</p>
<p>
<center><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Uw2ffk1.png" style="width: 500px; height: 774px;" /></center></p>

<p>
On Press Inc., supposedly a division of <a href="http://knopf.knopfdoubleday.com/" target="_blank">Knopf Publishing</a> (according to its Twitter profiles), was running a search of its own and issuing tweet after threatening tweet to anyone who dared publish a short (really short -- under 140 characters) poem by reclusive poet, <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/shaun-shane/biography/" target="_blank">Shaun Shane</a>, without attribution. The entire poem reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<i>"If only our tongues were made of glass, how much more careful we would be when we speak."</i></blockquote>
This poem's claim to fame is its use in the Invisible Children/Kony 2012 campaign. The link presented by On Press during these Twitter blowups is an <a href="https://twitter.com/invisible/status/197067812865445888/photo/1" target="_blank">Invisible Children-branded photo</a> that quotes the poem <i>and</i> gives proper attribution, albeit a possibly belated one. On Press' blood was first stirred up by a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/invisible-children-cover-the-night_n_1440379.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post story about Invisible Children back in April of 2012</a>, which led to this angry comment from On Press:
<blockquote>
<i>The Organization Invisible Children has plagiarized and thus committed copyright infringement ( which is illegal) on their website and on their Twitter account, a work by Shaun Shane. Exemplifying the criticism against them that they do not research their facts and have sloppy journalist methods. (Here is a link: http://www.invisiblechildren.com/) and to the Twitter post (https://twitter.com/#!/Invisible/status/196433854851055618/photo/1)</i></blockquote>
After sending out an ignored invitation (via direct message) to discuss these "tactics," I decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/TimCushing/status/299287346342404096" target="_blank">throw out some bait</a>.
<br /><br />
Soon, I was receiving the same set of tweets I'd seen filling up my search results the night before. On Press, utilizing one of its <i>many, many</i> Twitter accounts, gave me its usual combination of Shaun Shane info and legal threats. On Press has a very shaky grasp on IP law, but it doesn't let its ignorance stop it from trotting out nearly every term (plagiarism, theft) imaginable in hopes of quick compliance.
<br /><br />
The first false claim it makes is that Twitter will shut down an account for a single infringement violation. Not true. Twitter <i>may</i> shut down an account for <i>multiple</i> cases of infringement, but a single report won't result in the removal of an account, as is <a href="https://twitter.com/tos" target="_blank">clearly stated in the Twitter terms of service</a>. (On Press has also made claim that this process will shut down an account in 4 hours. You may laugh at this one.)
<blockquote>
<i>Twitter will also terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a <b>repeat infringer</b>.</i></blockquote>
If the proper steps are followed (via the DMCA form), the offending Tweet will simply be "withheld," with a notice replacing the original Tweet. Finally, On Press delivers this bizarre phrase:</p>
<center>
<p>
<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/HTnhtqF.png" style="width: 500px; height: 95px;" /></p>
</center>
<p>
For an entity so concerned with copyright infringement, it certainly doesn't seem to understand the terminology it's throwing around. "Libel" and "liable" are nowhere close to each other in definition, and you'd think an entity this concerned with infringement would know the difference (or at least be able to spell the one it actually means).
<br /><br />
Then there's On Press Inc itself, which has its own issues. As you can see from its profile photo, On Press claims to be a division of Knopf Publishing. However, we contacted Knopf Publishing for comment and they said that there is no division of Knopf called On Press Inc.  On Press has apparently decided an appearance of Shane's poem in a <a href="http://celebratepoetry.tumblr.com/post/21875771215/tongues-made-of-glass" target="_blank">Poem-A-Day-Celebration hosted by Tumblr and Knopf</a> allows it to add Knopf's name to its profile... and the large publisher's weight to its fight against unattributed use, despite no official connection to the company.
<br /><br />
On Press also utilizes multiple simultaneous Twitter accounts, in violation of the <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules" target="_blank">Twitter Rules</a>.
<blockquote>
<i><b>Serial Accounts</b>: You may not create serial accounts for disruptive or abusive purposes, or with overlapping use cases. Mass account creation may result in suspension of all related accounts. Please note that any violation of the Twitter Rules is cause for permanent suspension of all accounts.</i>
</blockquote>
In <i>one </i>night, my interactions with On Press Inc. included input from the following accounts: <a href="https://twitter.com/copyrightdept" target="_blank">@copyrightdept</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vesoaonpress" target="_blank">@vesoaonpress</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vseawonpress" target="_blank">@vseawonpress</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wasweonpress" target="_blank">@wasweonpress</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/xaswonpress" target="_blank">@xaswonpress</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/xseionpress" target="_blank">@xseionpress</a>. All accounts sported the same On Press logo and spouted the same tweets. One could try to make a claim that these accounts are not "disruptive" or "abusive" (and I'd <i>love </i>to watch them make that claim), but there's little doubt On Press Inc's multiple accounts are "overlapping." (@vseawonpress is the <i>only</i> account not suspended at the time of this writing.)
<br /><br />
Now, although I was receiving the same stream of misspellings and misinformation from On Press as the other users posting Shaun Shane's (unattributed) poem, I wasn't seeing any signs of life. I was pretty much convinced it was a bot running multiple accounts. To test that theory, I called out On Press on the false claims directed my way, specifically the assertion that Twitter would delete my account for a single violation. To my surprise, it provoked a very human reaction.</p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/bZ7lIbO.png" style="width: 500px; height: 203px;" /></center>
<p>
So, there <i>was</i> a human behind the account, one who handily provided a link to the terms of service that <i>directly contradicted</i> what he had just said. (I've shifted pronouns, but an explanation is on the way.)
<br /><br />
Once I had his/its attention, I pointed out On Press' suspicious behavior -- namely, the multiple suspended accounts linked to its name.</p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/6GqMz1J.png" style="width: 500px; height: 193px;" /></center>
<p>
On Press responded with this blast of angry tweets, stating that <i>Twitter itself</i> generated these accounts for it.</p>
<center>
<p>
<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/B7O9iNe.png" style="width: 500px; height: 639px;" /></p>
</center>
<p>
It shouldn't need to be said, but this claim is completely false. Mike contacted Twitter to ask about whether or not, as On Press claims, it creates thousands of automatically generated accounts for companies with which to harass infringers, and (no surprise) Twitter said there is no truth to this claim.
<br /><br />
I attempted to gather more information, but my overtures were rejected. At one point, an On Press account mentioned it performed this "service" for "other authors" but refused to name any. It also failed to cough up a usable URL that might indicate On Press Inc exists outside of multiple Twitter accounts.
<br /><br />
Shortly thereafter, the accounts went ballistic, showering me with a long list of legal threats.</p>
<center>
<p>
<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/c6o3IVA.png" style="width: 500px; height: 514px;" /></p>
</center>
<p>
This was prompted by its discovery of a tongue-in-cheek review of the <i>only</i> book On Press has for sale, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RVOPTWIHQE9NH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1467522619&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books" target="_blank">one I had posted earlier that night</a>. (You may notice a second review has suddenly appeared -- from the same person who showed up to criticize my review.)
<br /><br />
Again, On Press made several dubious claims, including the ridiculous suggestion that Twitter would surrender my IP address to the police on the strength of a fake review <i>posted on an entirely different site</i>. It also seemed to feel that the Feds would be interested simply because I was using a computer.
<br /><br />
However, he/it wasn't kidding about one thing: "legal prosecution." The morning following this bizarre conversation with On Press (Feb. 8th), Techdirt received a phone call seeking to confirm that I "worked for Techdirt," with the "lawyer" on the phone saying that he wished to serve me with a lawsuit (at Techdirt's headquarters) for "copyright infringement, defamation of character and making false claims."
<br /><br />
To date, nothing has been filed, despite the voicemail implying the lawsuit was already filed. But here's the great thing about legal threats: nothing being served to this point <i>doesn't</i> mean nothing ever will. The possibility still exists and the potential plaintiff is free to file anytime before the statute of limitations expires. This is likely a bluff, but it carries enough weight to make any future direct interaction with On Press ill advised, to say the least. This leaves him/it free to aggressively pursue those posting the poem without attribution, without worrying that I might ruin the fun by pointing out its false claims.
<br /><br />
With the threat of a lawsuit still hanging overhead, I'm simply going to present my findings, all backed up with screenshots and/or links, with a minimum of speculative commentary.
<br /><br />
<b>The On Press Inc. "Network"</b>
<br /><br />
First off, let's address the "him/it" issue. On Press Inc. seems to exist solely as multiple accounts spanning several social media platforms. Running a search will serve up a few hits on <i>existing</i> businesses with the same name, but I have confirmed that these are unrelated to this bizarre attribution trolling.
<br /><br />
<b>A Poem Is Nothing</b>
<br /><br />
Shane's book is print-on-demand. Amazon doesn't list it this way, <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?afn_sr=gan&kn=shaun+shane&lkid=j28638937k118316&pfxid=a_1565288563&pubid=k118316&sortby=17&tn=A+Poem+Is+Nothing" target="_blank">but other booksellers do</a>. So, there's no pile of unsold paperbacks sitting in an On Press warehouse. This may explain why there's so little effort made to provide infringers with a "buy" link during the barrage of tweets and comments.
<br /><br />
The On Press Twitter horde usually presents two links. One of them leads to this video displaying "proof" that someone (d/b/a On Press, Inc., with no address displayed) holds the copyright to "Tongues Made of Glass." (The other links to the Invisible Children photo.)</p>
<center>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GL_BUE-kGyw?rel=0" width="500"></iframe></center>
<p>
Now, a video like this could be made by literally <i>anyone</i> (with hands) and hardly presents a solid case for On Press' claim to Shaun Shane's poem. None of his work has been registered at the US Copyright office, either by himself or by On Press (or by <i>anyone</i>, actually). This limits any legal liability for infringement to actual proven damages, making the threat of a lawsuit slightly more tolerable.  Also, the claims made at the end of the video, which appear to be a bastardization of the typical "copyright policies" found on sporting events, saying no copies can be made "without written consent of the publisher," overstates the powers given under copyright law in ignoring the possibility of fair use or other exceptions to copyright law.
<br /><br />
Interestingly, the voice on the "copyright" video sounds nearly identical to Shaun Shane himself. Shane has a very distinctive cadence and tone to his voice, as evidenced by this live performance.</p>
<center>
<p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hYmzICCp3mQ?rel=0" width="500"></iframe></p>
</center>
<p>
[Shane's voice also bears heavy, heavy resemblance to that of James Roth ("representing On Press Incorporated"), the caller who contacted Techdirt about serving me with the lawsuit.]
<br /><br />
So, is On Press simply Shaun Shane, reclusive poet <i>and</i> attribution seeker? He'd certainly be the person most interested in enforcing this. His <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/shaun-shane/biography/" target="_blank">impossibly glowing bio at PoemHunter puts Shane in Schrodinger's Box</a>, theorizing that he's dead ("...<i>had become terminally ill and his re-emergence was to reinforce the ethic of Pure Poetry or Truly Modernist Poetry before his death</i>..."), before theorizing in the opposite direction a few sentences later ("<i>though it is believed, if he is still alive, he lives on the West Coast...</i>") One of the On Press Twitter accounts I dealt with claimed Shane was dead and had willed that his work be used to raise money for various children's charities. (Too bad no one's trying to sell that book...) <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/279997301804738948/" target="_blank">This claim is echoed at Pinterest</a>, where the same sort of attribution-badgering occurs.<br />
<br />
<b>Mike Miche</b>
<br /><br />
Whether Mr. Miche is real or simply Shaun using another name remains to be proven. (It does share a Shaun Shane-like bit of alliteration.) <a href="http://pinterest.com/onpress/activity/" target="_blank">Miche patrols Pinterest</a>, sending users who re-pin this photo the same sort of messages as the Twitter accounts do, only without the character limit.
<br /><br />
Miche also sports the same shaky legal grasp and penchant for baseless threats.</p>
<center>
<p>
<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/fv15aa7.png" style="width: 499px; height: 338px;" /></p>
</center>
<p>
Here Miche chases down a user (who deleted her tweet) and continues harassing her at her Pinterest account, claiming that people like her using an unattributed quote can "cause untold billions of dollars of lost [sic] for companies who support and publisher [sic] Authors [sic... again] works." Miche also seems to make the claim that she's legally responsible for any retweets (a claim echoed in return by the On Press Twitter accounts).
<br /><br />
Also of note: <a href="https://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512c/notice.cgi?NoticeID=725583" target="_blank">the single DMCA notice</a> attributed to On Press was issued by Mike Miche. The notice has the sender's name redacted, but a <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22mike+miche%22+%22on+press%22" target="_blank">duckduckgo search reveals Miche's name in the search results</a>. If this is <i>really</i> Shaun Shane, he's either using false information to file DMCA notices, or Mike Miche is his real name (Shaun Shane is a pseudonym, according to his bio).<br />

<b>Alexandria Hopewell</b><br />

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000120590417" target="_blank">Hopewell</a> has sent out similar messages to Facebook users, again seeking attribution and using identical wording.</p>

There are a few differences that might indicate she was just "pitching in" with the attribution push ("This Poem is our copyrighted property your use of it uncredited to him constitutes thief."), but by and large, it resembles missives issued at other platforms. <br />
<br />
A followup on one post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/soulseeds/posts/185915534888412" target="_blank">switches from "informative" to "pissed off" instantly when challenged</a>, much like my earlier interactions with Shaun/On Press did when I refused to play ball:
<blockquote>
<i>We send and deal with 1000's of take down notices every day. Hardly do we need your amateurish insight into what constitutes legal and effective enforcement of our Copyright .</i></blockquote>

Hopewell is a <i>real</i> human being, however, and is very definitely <i>not</i> Shaun Shane. She has <a href="https://plus.google.com/102240974978461427677/about" target="_blank">an account at Google+</a>, and her writing there doesn't bear much resemblance to what's posted on Facebook. There is <a href="https://plus.google.com/102240974978461427677/posts/9hVxiTMf4dn" target="_blank">a <i>very</i> interesting interaction on her timeline</a> that indicates "Shaun Shane" is probably alive.</p>

A user named "<a href="https://plus.google.com/106949125235767878026/posts" target="_blank">Sean Seans</a>" refers to himself as "Shaun" and tells her he loves and misses her. And that Sean Seans/Shaun is also busy <a href="https://plus.google.com/106812356268467376471/posts/hFDkzyCBCWn" target="_blank">chasing down wrongdoers</a> posting unattributed poems.</p>

<br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/anne.murphy.90226" target="_blank">Anne Murphy</a> has also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jennysookie/posts/525830334113110" target="_blank">made posts on Facebook</a> concerning Shane's poem and seems to be located in Texas (at least judging from the locations of most of her Friends). The wording is almost identical to the Facebook posts by Alexandria Hopewell, suggesting the same author wrote them. She has also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/annemurphy171?feature=watch" target="_blank">uploaded a few videos of Shaun Shane performances to YouTube</a>. (Interestingly, the phone number on the caller ID from the call by "James Roth" to contact Techdirt is registered to Anne Murphy and also to a vegetable farm, the O.P. Murphy Produce Company -- both in Texas.  Also worth noting: there does not appear to be a "James Roth" listed on the Texas state bar.  If whoever called is not, in fact, a lawyer, they might want to familiarize themselves with Texas law <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/PE/8/38/38.122" target="_blank">38.122</a> which makes it a felony to impersonate a lawyer.)<br />
<br />
But that's not all. Shane/On Press also <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tumblr+%22on+press+inc%22&oq=tumblr+%22on+press+inc%22&aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3j62l2.5331&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">stalks Tumblr with multiple accounts</a> (some of which are filled with work-from-home scam posts), issuing the now-familiar statements demanding attribution. A search for the terms <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tumblr+%22on+press+inc%22&oq=tumblr+%22on+press+inc%22&aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3j62l2.5331&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&tbo=d&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22shaun+shane%22+%22on+press%22&oq=%22shaun+shane%22+%22on+press%22&gs_l=serp.3..35i39.50581.57432.1.57668.24.24.0.0.0.0.218.3654.0j22j2.24.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.2.serp.tX9sCnpefEY&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.42261806,d.aWM&fp=cecfd734039d8d45&biw=902&bih=854" target="_blank">"Shaun Shane" and "On Press"</a> also brings up hits on several other platforms. On Press/Shane is very busy, though (as far as I can see) never seems to direct anyone towards buying the actual book.
<br /><br />
He has also ramped up the aggression, perhaps as a result of his "successful" legal threat. The On Press Twitter interactions were never pleasant, but the latest ones have a decidedly malevolent tone that's undercut slightly by the sheer number of false claims they contain. It doesn't help that the poem is most frequently tweeted by teens -- a demographic On Press/Shane seems to enjoy hurling threats towards.
<br /><br />
On Press now threatens to <a href="http://storify.com/TimCushing#stories" target="_blank">contact the police, sue parents and hold teens responsible for any retweets their followers send out</a>. Here's a few choice quotes:
<blockquote><i>
"know that you can be track by your ip address and that your parents will be the one's who are sued since you are a minor..."
<br /><br />
"know that the average cost is $4000.00 per instance but that is times the number of follwers you have, or the number people who are exposed to your illegal post..."
<br /><br />
"...but if you were bright you wouldn't have been stupid enought to tweet the poem in the first place..."
<br /><br />
"WE don't care if you care. Your account will be terminated that is all that matters to us. We are indifferent to your feelings about it. your just some dumb kid."
</i></blockquote>
There are some interesting legal theories mixed up in there that we have not seen before.  I particularly like the idea that infringement is multiplied by the number of followers you have.  This would appear to be an entirely novel interpretation (by which I mean "wrong") of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504" target="_blank">17 USC 504</a>, which has always been clear that the amount of statutory damages paid is <i>per work</i> infringed, not by the number of people who saw the work.
<br /><br />
So, what's the point? Why should we care? On Press/Shane is just seeking attribution. It's not like he's sending out settlement letters. Well, for starters, this is <i>not</i> how the system is supposed to work. Those concerned about infringement are directed to Twitter's DMCA form, which to date, On Press has used only once. Apparently, this method is much less satisfying than the instant feedback one gets while hounding Twitter users (even going so far as to follow them to other platforms, as Mike Miche [above] did).
<br /><br />
I'm not pissed off that On Press circumvents a system many rights holders find inefficient. <b>I'm pissed off that On Press deceives people about its relationship with a major publisher, using that as leverage to harass users with a variety of baseless threats</b>. It doesn't help that the users receiving the most abuse are teenagers who did nothing more than post a quote they liked, who are then threatened with arrest and lawsuits against their parents in return.
<br /><br />
I'm pissed off that <b>On Press is fighting a battle it can't win</b> utilizing bullying tactics. It seems to want respect, but keeps forgetting respect is something you earn -- not something you beat into people. People may start to respect the stick, but they'll never respect the entity wielding it.
<br /><br />
Furthermore, if I was a rights holder hoping to protect my creations, I'd be pissed off that someone out there is doing serious damage to copyright itself with a scorched earth policy of baseless threats and vindictive bullying. It makes it <i>that much</i> harder to fight infringement when any existing level of respect has been torn down by another's overly aggressive tactics.
<br /><br />
Finally, if I'm Shaun Shane, and I'm <i>not</i> behind this? <b>I'm fucking furious</b>. Any potential legacy or possibility of expanding my audience has been absolutely <i>destroyed</i> by someone who has used my name to harangue internet users across multiple platforms, utilizing angry missives filled with misspellings, deception, baseless legal threats and a very dangerous misunderstanding of IP law in general.
<br /><br />
And Shaun, if this is actually you? You're only hurting yourself and your reputation by hammering unwitting Twitter users (among others) for this act of omission. There's nothing wrong with seeking proper attribution. But there are so many methods that work better than this. You can't stop unattributed quotes from flying around the internet. You can't even slow it down.
<br /><br />
Do you seriously think anyone's going to Google a tweet to make sure it doesn't belong to someone else before retweeting it? Do you really think people are going to Google "Shaun Shane" unless you bring it up first? Pinterest users, right or wrong, aren't going to do a reverse image search before repinning. Sure, it sucks that stuff strays so far from the original creators, but that's the price you pay for unprecedented access to millions of creative works.
<br /><br />
But the benefits outweigh the negatives. Unprecedented access works both ways. You can connect with potential fans and customers in ways that simply weren't possible 10 years ago. If you're only going to see the worst aspects, you'll never be anything more than a set of empty words and threats, spat endlessly into a void, covered in vitriol and self-righteousness. You've crafted a poem with viral possibilities but you're only interested in slamming every door shut as soon as it opens. This final perspective doesn't make me angry. It just makes me sad. There's so much potential but you're too angry to see it. You, and only you, can turn this around.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Ah, okay, so now you're for plagiarism too</h3><div class="cbody">The  anti-artist  tilt  of  this  blog  is  amazing.  So  many  paragraphs  about  something  so  simple.  In  the  past,  this  blog  said  we  should  all  learn  to  love  piracy  because  it  would  bring  the  artist  more  publicity.  The  artist  would  then  be  able  to  trade  this  for  more  book  sales  or  concert  ticket  sales  or  something  else.  <br /> 
<br />
But  now,  when  faced  with  the  potential  to  say  something  on  behalf  of  the  artist  to  defend  this  pro-publicity  gambit,  you  don't  hesitate  to  go  negative  on  the  artists.  Whammo.  Even  asking  for  attribution  is  being  greedy  and  selfish.<br />
<br />
And  yet  there  you  were  grousing  and  complaining  when  Slashdot  was  grabbing  your  stories  without  attribution.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Ah, okay, so now you're for plagiarism too</h3><div class="cbody">Ann  again,  you  can  read  the  words  on  the  screen  but  cannot  process  the  meaning.<br />
<br />
From  the  article  -  "There's  nothing  wrong  with  seeking  proper  attribution.  But  there  are  so  many  methods  that  work  better  than  this"<br />
<br />
the  issue  the  article  raises  is  the  tact  and  method  used  to  get  the  attribution.    Stating  blatant  lies  about  copyright  law,  Twitters  TOS,  who  they  are  associated  and  many  other  methods  harm  the  reputation  of  the  author,  and  possibly  kill  any  future  associations  other  authors  or  publishers  would  be  willing  to  have  with  him.    <br /> 
<br />
Had  he  gone  around  sending  a  message  to  the  twitter  users  who  posted  the  quote,  thanking  them  for  spreading  there  work  but  asking  to  be  attributed,  they  probably  would  have  gotten  a  much  more  favorable  result.    For  example,  the  story  from  yesterday  where  the  developer  reached  out  those  who  posted  their  game  on  TPB.  <a> <a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130212/10325521952/game-developer-connects-with-pirates-sees-massive-support-deletion-torrents.shtml' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"> http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130212/10325521952/game-developer-connects-with-pirates-sees-mass ive-support-deletion-torrents.shtml</a></a>,</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?cid=454#addyourcomment" cid="454" subject="Re: Ah, okay, so now you're for plagiarism too" cid="454" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_454" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml#c454">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?threaded=true#c454">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Ah, okay, so now you're for plagiarism too</h3><div class="cbody">"The  anti-artist  tilt  of  this  blog  is  amazing."<br />
<br />
This  isn't  an  anti-artists  article,  not  even  remotely.  This  is  about  someone  going  apeshit  on  Twitter  (and  various  other  websites)  and  resorting  to  making  legal  threats  that  have  no  basis  in  any  current  laws,  all  while  committing  what  is  essentially  fraud.  (Lest  you  overlook  the  Knopf  Publishing  factor,  which  they're  claiming  to  be  a  part  of.)<br />
<br />
"So  many  paragraphs  about  something  so  simple."<br />
<br />
Well  when  you  boil  it  down  completely...  sure.  But  it  is  anything  but  simple,  which  the  article  (had  you  bothered  to  read  it,  but  which  you  likely  didn't)  goes  into  depth  pointing  out  and  discussing  further.  Ranging  from  how  it  began,  to  where  it  went  and  likely  will  go.  <br /> 
<br />
"In  the  past,  this  blog  said  we  should  all  learn  to  love  piracy  because  it  would  bring  the  artist  more  publicity."<br />
<br />
Never  has  that  been  said  on  this  blog.  What  has  been  said  is  that  wasting  time  fighting  piracy  is  a  never  ending  endeavor  in  futility,  which  is  time  that  could  be  better  spent  doing  something  more  fruitful.  Like  connecting  with  fans,  creating  and/or  offering  products  that  can't  be  pirated,  etc.<br />
<br />
"The  artist  would  then  be  able  to  trade  this  for  more  book  sales  or  concert  ticket  sales  or  something  else."<br />
<br />
Uh,  no.  The  artists  COULD  potentially  ignore  the  futility  of  fighting  piracy  and  do  something  like  I  posted  above,  which  would  THEN  POTENTIALLY  transform  into  further  sales  of  their  product.  But  it's  not  at  all  the  way  you  stated  it  to  be.  My  way  more  accurately  reflects  what  is  advocated  for  on  this  site.<br />
<br />
"But  now,  when  faced  with  the  potential  to  say  something  on  behalf  of  the  artist  to  defend  this  pro-publicity  gambit,  you  don't  hesitate  to  go  negative  on  the  artists."<br />
<br />
No  one  is  getting  negative  on  the  artist.  You  really  need  to  practice  reading  comprehension.  <br /> 
<br />
A  situation  has  come  to  light,  one  in  which  an  artist  himself  may  be  engaging  in  not  only  legal  bully  but  potentially  fraud  (because  I  am  a  Texan  and  it  is  relatively  common  knowledge  that  presenting  yourself  as  an  attorney  when  you  are  not  is  a  serious  offense  here).  <br /> 
<br />
What  is  relevant  to  this  website,  which  you  obviously  have  no  clue  about,  is  that  if  it  is  the  artist  who  is  creating  these  abusive  and  fraudulent  (lest  we  ignore  the  Knopf  bit  again,  which  you  obviously  did),  is  that  should  Shane  be  the  one  doing  this  legal  as  well  as  general  bullying  (in  the  form  of  insulting  people  online)  he  is  going  about  things  in  a  most  harmful  manner  to  himself  as  an  artist.  <br /> 
<br />
If  it  is  him  doing  all  this,  which  we  aren't  sure  it  is,  he  could  have  merely  created  a  Twitter  account  of  his  own  (as  himself)  and  politely  asked  people  to  attribute  the  specific  quoted  poem  to  him,  as  he's  the  one  who  wrote  it.  Most  gladly  would.  Many  people  love  poetry  and  stories,  but  sometimes  it's  hard  to  find  out  who  wrote  them.  So  they  don't  attribute  them  to  anyone  or  put  "Unknown".  Shane  could  easily  have  corrected  this  innocent  oversight  and  potentially  made  a  few  fans,  firstly  by  letting  people  know  who  he  was  to  begin  with  and  secondly  by  being  cool  about  it.  As  in,  "Hey,  see  you  quoted  that  bit  up  there.  Just  so  you  know,  I  wrote  that.  I've  got  some  other  stuff  you  might  be  interested  in  if  you  liked  that,  feel  free  to  check  it  out.  Thanks!  Have  an  awesome  day!"  Simple  as  that.  (Maybe  not  so  simple,  since  Twitter  has  a  160  character  limit,  but  you  get  my  point.<br />
<br />
"Whammo."<br />
<br />
Ah  yes,  the  infamous  I  don't  have  a  point  so  I'll  make  a  one  word  declarative  (and  irrelevant)  statement  giving  the  false  impression  of  any  point  up  to  this  point  having  not  been  actually  made.<br />
<br />
"Even  asking  for  attribution  is  being  greedy  and  selfish."<br />
<br />
I  guess  you  missed  the  entire  article  where  the  artist  himself  has  not  actually  asked  for  attribution,  but  instead  resorted  to  legal  bullying  to  have  people  take  down  the  content.  Keep  in  mind,  he  could  have  simply  asked  for  attribution,  assuming  he  is  the  one  doing  this,  but  instead  he's  making  demands  that  people  remove  the  content  and  spreading  lies  and  misinformation  about  Twitter,  copyright  law,  etc.<br />
<br />
So  no,  he  didn't  ask  for  attribution.  As  such  he  can't  be  considered  greedy  and  selfish  for  doing  so.  And  in  point  of  fact,  he  wouldn't  be  even  if  he  did  ask  for  that,  as  no  one  would  think  it  greedy  or  selfish  to  be  acknowledged.<br />
<br />
"And  yet  there  you  were  grousing  and  complaining  when  Slashdot  was  grabbing  your  stories  without  attribution."<br />
<br />
Techdirt  has  routinely  stated  people  can  do  what  they  want  with  the  articles  here.  Copy/paste  them  entirely  elsewhere.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  it'll  drive  traffic  up  here  when  people  find  them  (through  Big  Search/Google...  GASP!!!)  and  end  up  back  here.<br />
<br />
Mike  himself  has  stated  this  on  more  than  one  occasion,  but  of  course  you'd  have  to  actually  pay  attention  to  what  is  being  said  to  get  that.  As  opposed  to  skimming  things  and  then  misinterpreting  the  few  key  words  you  look  for  and  responding  to  that.<br />
<br />
"Sheesh."<br />
<br />
That's  exactly  the  word  that  pops  into  my  head  every  time  you  post  and  every  time  I  personally  shred  your  comments  to  pieces  line  by  line.  <br /> 
<br />
It's  like  you  don't  learn  that  you're  beyond  retarded  and  some  of  us  are  more  intelligent  and  going  to  debunk  everything  you  say  from  the  moment  we  see  it.<br />
<br />
Sheesh.  Go  to  a  library.  Make  use  of  Google.  But  seriously,  get  a  fucking  clue.  You've  been  around  long  enough  and  I've  said  it  enough  times  to  you  that  you'd  think  by  now  you'd  use  that  thing  between  your  ears  (your  brain)  and  try  and  learn  something  before  posting  pendejadas.  ("Pendejadas"  for  those  who  don't  speak  Spanish  is  basically,  "stupid,  retarded  nonsense/bullshit".  It's  a  way  of  saying  that  someone  is  saying  or  writing  such  stupidity  that  it's  hard  to  believe  and  doesn't  need  more  than  one  word,  in  Spanish,  to  describe  what's  being  said/written.)</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?cid=646#addyourcomment" cid="646" subject="Re: Ah, okay, so now you're for plagiarism too" cid="646" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_646" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml#c646">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?threaded=true#c646">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

Poor  On  Press  Inc.  I  wonder  if  Knopf  Publishing's  legal  counsel  would  be  interested  in  knowing  that  you  are  misrepresenting  yourself  as  a  part  of  their  company.  Especially  since  while  misrepresenting  yourself  as  a  branch  of  their  company  your  douchebaggery  (and  lack  glaring  lack  of  knowledge  of  the  law)  you  are  doing  harm  to  their  company  name.  <br /> 
<br />
I  love  the  internet  and  technology.  Not  the  least  reason  for  which  is  because  when  idiots  get  a  hold  of  it/make  use  of  it  their  stupidity  is  readily  there  for  the  world  to  see  (and  some  who  try  and  abuse  the  law  get  slapped  down  by  it  and  those  who  actually  know  about  it).<br />
<br />
On  Press  Inc  sued  by  Knopf  Publishing,  which  is  owned  by  Random  House,  for  misrepresentation/fraud.  News  at  11.  <br />

Also,  your  grammar  usage  is  poor  and  borders  on  illiterate.    )<br />

Hang  on.  When  you  use  another's  work  uncredited,  you  have  to  credit  the  author?<br />
<br />
That  is  literally  not  possible.  If  you're  using  a  quote  <b> uncredited</b>,  by  definition,  you  can't  credit  the  author  at  the  same  time.  If  you  do  credit  the  author  while  using  the  quote,  it's  no  longer  uncredited.  Does  On  Press  think  that  copyright  law  is  supposed  to  be  some  kind  of  confusing  <i> Catch-22</i>-type  situation  where  it's  impossible  to  follow  the  law  because  the  law  is  inherently  contradictory,  therefore  you  are  a  violator?  That...  okay,  that  just  makes  my  head  hurt.<br />
<br />
Also,  even  if  you  overlook  that  part  by  reasonably  interpreting  it  as  "you  have  to  credit  the  author  afterward",  they  almost  make  it  sound  like  if  you  falsely  attributed  the  quote,  it  would  be  <em> way</em>  more  okay  than  using  it  without  any  credit  at  all,  since  you  only  really  <em> have</em>  to  credit  the  author  if  you  previously  used  the  work  uncredited.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?cid=1641#addyourcomment" cid="1641" subject="" cid="1641" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1641" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml#c1641">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?threaded=true#c1641">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Consider this...</h3><div class="cbody">When  I  first  read  this  article,  my  first  reaction  was  "WTF?  This  guy  is  just  batshit  crazy!"    But  the  more  I  thought  about  it,  the  more  I  got  a  clearer  picture  of  what  I  think  is  going  on.    With  IP  issues,  there  are  generally  3  types  of  people.  There  are  the  maximalists  on  one  side  that  want  to  use  it  to  squeeze  every  ounce  of  income  they  can  out  of  the  public.  There  are  those  outraged  by  these  attempts  and  fight  against  them.    And  then  there  are  the  vast  majority  of  people  who  don't  know  or  seem  to  care  about  these  issues  at  all  because  they  don't  think  these  issues  affect  them.    It  is  this  last  group  that  is  key.    A  substantial  portion  of  the  people  who  post  and  repost  content  in  social  media  falls  into  this  group  and  I  think  this  is  the  group  he  may  be  trying  to  reach.    By  making  baseless  threats  against  these  people  he  is  making  these  issues  affect  them.  I  see  this  as  leveraging  the  Streisand  Effect  to  move  them  to  care.    By  making  the  threats  ridiculous  he  is  showing  how  ridiculous  the  people  who  use  these  tactics  are.    It  has  been  said  that  there  is  a  fine  line  between  genius  and  crazy  and  people  who  don't  get  it,  will  assume  the  latter.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?cid=1784#addyourcomment" cid="1784" subject="Consider this..." cid="1784" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1784" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml#c1784">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?threaded=true#c1784">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

I  wonder  if  anyone  has  informed  Amazon  they  are  offering  a  print  on  demand  book  that  has  no  clear  copyright,  they  could  be  assisting  someone  in  ripping  off  an  artist  or  assisting  in  commercial  copyright  infringement.<br />
<br />
As  the  people  maintaining  the  artists  online  information  have  claimed  the  artist  is  dead,  there  is  no  registered  copyright,  no  tangible  leads  to  the  alleged  company,  oh  and  misrepresenting  themselves  as  part  of  a  major  publisher  who  has  never  heard  of  them...  I  think  Amazon  should  consider  the  poor  artist  and  stop  the  sales  until  such  time  as  they  produce  the  proper  documentation  to  shore  up  their  ownership  claims.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?cid=2084#addyourcomment" cid="2084" subject="" cid="2084" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_2084" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml#c2084">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130211/20400521946/bizarre-attribution-troll-bullies-twitter-users-into-compliance-with-baseless-legal-threats.shtml?threaded=true#c2084">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

That  way  you  can  learn  that  words  that  sound  the  same  (your,  you're,  it's,  its,  there,  their,  they're)  don't  mean  the  same  thing.    You'll  also  learn  sentence  diagramming,  which  will  help  your  illiteracy  as  you'll  see  verbs  really  ARE  required  in  a  sentence.<br />
<br />
Need  more  meds.    The  Shaun  multi-personality-beast  appears  stupid  and  illiterate.    This  will  not  sell  more  bs  books  of  hokey  poems.<br />
<br />
If  only  our  tongues  were  made  from  glass  would  ass-kissers  cause  bleeding  rectums?<br />
