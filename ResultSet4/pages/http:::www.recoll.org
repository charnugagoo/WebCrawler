	  the file with a single mouse click. There is little that
	  will remain hidden on your disk.

      <h2>News</h2>
      <div class="news">
      <dl>
        <dt>2012-12-14</dt><dd>The next version of Recoll indexing will be
          multithreaded, and much faster on most current
          processors. The conversion has been an interesting project
          with multiple stages, and I've taken 
          <a href="idxthreads/threadingRecoll.html">a few  notes</a> 
          about the transformation.</dd>
        </dd>

        <dt>2012-11-23</dt><dd>Released a minor update to the very
          stable 1.17
          branch: <a href="download-1.17.html">1.17.4</a>.
          <a href="release-1.17.html">release notes</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>2012-11-05</dt><dd>Recoll 1.18.1 is out. It has optional
          character case and diacritics 
          sensitivity, direct access to the hit page when opening PDF
          files, complex search history, and a host of other smaller
          improvements. See the <a href="release-1.18.html">release
            notes</a>.
          <span class="important">Those of you not using <b>evince</b>
          as a PDF/Postscript/DVI viewer may be surprised to see the
          recoll GUI try to use this viewer anyway.</span>This is because
            some of the new functions in 1.18 work better
            with <b>evince</b>, but you can override the choice by
            going to the GUI preferences, and removing
            application/pdf, application/postscript and
            application/dvi from the <tt>Exceptions</tt> list.
        </dd>

        <dt>2012-10-30</dt> <dd>Recoll has a brand new Firefox extension for
          indexing visited Web pages. This is very similar to the old
          Beagle plugin, but slightly better integrated (no-fuss
          installation), and with a new lease on life. See
          <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/recollfirefox/">
            Dave King's project page on sourceforge</a> and the
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/IndexWebHistory">
            page about Recoll (trivial) configuration</a>.</dd>

        <dt>2012-10-30</dt> <dd>The source for <a href="recoll-1.18.003.tar.gz">
            recoll 1.18.003</a> is available, and this is a call to
            volunteers to test it. There are binary packages on the recoll
            "experimental" PPA for Ubuntu and Mint Linux users, and I can
            build others. See this
     <a href="http://www.freelists.org/post/recoll-user/recoll-1180-prerelease">
            message</a> for more information. Mini-release 003 fixes a GUI
            crash and a few other issues in 002.</dd>
        </dd>

        <dt>2012-10-25</dt> <dd>A problem with a simple workaround has caused
          several reported <span class="important">recollindex
          crashes</span> recently (for 1.17). If you store and index
          Mozilla/Thunderbird email out of the standard location
          (~/.thunderbird), you should add the following at the end of
          your configuration file (e.g.:
          ~/.recoll/recoll.conf): <pre><tt>
              [/path/to/my/mozilla/mail]
              mhmboxquirks = tbird
          </tt></pre> Adjust the path to your local value of course...
          Without this hint, recollindex has trouble finding the
          message delimiters inside the folder files, and will
          possibly use all the computer's memory and crash. Apart from
          crashes, which only occur for very big folders, this also
          causes incorrect mail indexing.

        <dt>2012-09-13</dt> <dd>The next Recoll version will
          acquire switchable 
          case and diacritics sensitivity. I am writing

          real-time indexing on laptops: stop or start indexing

        <dt>2012-06-19</dt> <dd>Update info. If you are not running
          Recoll 1.17.3, you probably should. 1.17.2 and older versions
          have a bug which 
          can cause a crash of the indexing process while processing email,
          under relatively common conditions.<br>
          Also, if you are already running 1.17.3, you may want to install
          the updated open/libre-office filter described just below.</dd>

        <dt>2012-03-27</dt> <dd>Recoll gets a Ubuntu Unity Lens. If
        you are running
          an Ubuntu release where this makes sense, you can install
          the recoll-lens package from the 
          <a href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/recoll-1.15-on">
            Recoll PPA</a>. The Lens uses the Recoll GUI as a proxy to
          extract and display embedded documents, which native utilities
          can't reach directly. And of course you still need to run
          the GUI (or the command line recollindex) to get the indexing
          going !</dd>
