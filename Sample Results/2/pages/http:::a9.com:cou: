<p><strong><span class="clear">DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="clear">THIS SITE IS PROVIDED BY A9.COM ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. A9.COM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THIS SITE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, OR MATERIALS INCLUDED ON THIS SITE.

A9.COM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THIS SITE, ITS SERVERS, OR E-MAIL SENT FROM A9.COM ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

<p><strong><span class="clear">APPLICABLE LAW</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="clear">By visiting A9.com, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and A9.com.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="clear">DISPUTES</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="clear">Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to A9.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="clear">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</span></p>
<p><span class="clear">To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98051. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, A9.com, Inc. will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</span></p>
<p><span class="clear">We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="clear">SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="clear">Please review our other policies. These policies also govern your visit to A9.com. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</span></p>
