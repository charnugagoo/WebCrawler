<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only SVN access</h1>

<p>Our SVN source repository is available read-only to the public at
large.  That way you can pick up any version (including releases) of
GCC that is in our repository.</p>

<p>Our web pages are still maintained via CVS, and can be accessed
using the directions for <a href="cvs.html">our CVS setup</a>.</p>

<p>In addition you can <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/">browse
our SVN history online</a>.</p>


<h2>Using the SVN repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have version 1.0.0 and higher of
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> installed, you can
check out the GCC sources using the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk SomeLocalDir</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are behind a firewall that does not allow the svn protocol
through, you can replace <code>svn://</code> with <code>http://</code>.
You may also need to modify your subversion servers file
(~/.subversion/servers) to set <code>http-proxy-host</code> and
<code>http-proxy-port</code>.  You should only use the http protocol if
the svn protocol does not work; the http protocol has a higher server
overhead associated with it and will be slower.</p>

<p>There is more <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SvnHelp">information
about Subversion specifically for GCC</a> in the GCC Wiki.</p>

<h3 id="generated_files">Generated files</h3>

<p>Our source tree contains a number of files that are generated
from other source files by build tools such as Bison, Autoconf, and
Gperf.  Bison is now required when using SVN to access our sources,
but all other generated files are included in the source tree so that
GCC can be built without these build tools. The SVN checkout and
update operations do not insure that the timestamps of generated files
are later than those of the files they are generated from.  The script
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code> updates the timestamps for all these
generated files.  See the comments in that script for instructions on
running it.</p>

<p>GCC's build system (in particular Make) uses file timestamps to
determine if a generated file needs to be updated by running a particular
build tool.  Because of this, GCC's build system may believe that
a generated file needs regenerating even though its source has not
changed, and require a particular build tool to rebuild that generated
file.  If the appropriate build tool is installed on your system, then
this will not be a problem.  If you do not intend to make changes to
the source, you can avoid installing these build tools by running
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code>.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion of removing these generated files
from GCC's SVN source tree (there is no discussion of removing them
from the released source tarballs).  If that happens then
building GCC from the SVN source tree would require installing
the above mentioned build tools.  Installing these build tools is not
particularly difficult, but can be time consuming especially if you
only occasionally install GCC on a particular system.</p>

<p>The build tools that GCC uses are all available from the GNU
Project (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>),
are often already available on many  systems, and can often be found
already built for some systems.  A partial list of these build tools
is: Autoconf, Bison, Xgettext, Automake, and Gperf.</p>

<h3>Conflicts when using <code>svn update</code></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to get svn conflict messages for some generated files
when updating your local sources from the SVN repository.  Typically such
conflicts occur with autoconf generated files.</p>

<p>As long as you haven't been making modifications to the generated files
or the generator files, it is safe to delete the offending file, then run
<code>svn update</code> again to get a new copy.</p>


<h2 id="tags">Branches and Tags</h2>

<p>A branch called <em>branchname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches/<em>branchname</em> gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>(The release branch of the latest version of GCC <em>x</em>.<em>y</em>
is named <code>gcc-<em>x</em>_<em>y</em>-branch</code>.)</p>


<p>Similarly a tag called <em>tagname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/tags/<em>tagname</em> gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>(For recent releases, the SVN tag for GCC <i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>.<i>Z</i>
is of the form
<code>gcc_<em>X</em>_<em>Y</em>_<em>Z</em>_release</code>.)</p>


<p>The following list provides some representative examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gcc-4_3-branch</li>
  <li>gcc_4_3_4_release</li>
  <li>gcc_4_3_3_release</li>
  <li>gcc_4_3_2_release</li>
  <li>gcc_4_3_1_release</li>
  <li>gcc_4_3_0_release</li>

  <li>gcc_3_4_2_release</li>
  <li>gcc_3_4_1_release</li>
  <li>gcc_3_4_0_release</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a list of available branches, use the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>svn ls svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p> To find out the revision/date at which a branch or tag was created, use
the command <code>svn log --stop-on-copy</code>.</p>

  It is no longer maintained.</dd>

  <dt>new-regalloc-branch</dt>
  <dd>Daniel Berlin and Michael Matz were working on an implementation

  <dt>structure-aliasing-branch</dt>

  The branch was maintained by Daniel Berlin.  It is no longer
  maintained.</dd>

  <dt><a href="projects/cfo.html">cfo-branch</a></dt>

  a collection of useful log information generated by the optimizers. 
  This branch was maintained by Devang Patel.  It is no longer
  maintained.</dd>

  <dt>insn-select</dt>
  <dd>This branch aimed to implement in early instruction selection
  and register class selection pass, which runs before register allocation
  and subsumes the current <code>regclass</code> pass.  In particular
  the goal is to chose an alternative per instruction, usable as a base
  during register allocation, which ideally is not changed during reload
  if registers could be allocated.  This will not be possible in all cases,
  especially when addresses generated during spilling will be invalid on
  the target machine.  But we should be able to do away with fake register
  classes representing strict unions of other register classes.  The
  branch was maintained by Michael Matz.  It is no longer
  maintained.</dd>
  
  <dt>addressing-modes</dt>
  <dd>This branch aimed to clean up the way base and index registers are
  handled by target headers.  In particular, the strict and non-strict
  meaning of these registers are unified and a common API is presented to
  implementations of the target macros.  Obsolete target macros will also
  be removed.  The branch was maintained by Paolo Bonzini.  It is no
  longer maintained.</dd>

  Patches added on this branch might not be appropriate for the GCC 3.3
  branch due to our policies concerning release branches.  All patches
  were added to mainline GCC (for 3.4).</dd>

  <dt>objc-improvements-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch was originally used to merge Objective-C bug fixes and
  enhancements from Apple Computer into the FSF tree; this has now been
  completed.  A later purpose of the branch was to implement the
  Objective-C++ language in the FSF GCC source tree. The message thread
