This is the home page of "SLOCCount", a set of tools for
counting physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) in a large number of languages
of a potentially large set of programs.
This suite of tools was used in my papers
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc">
<i>More than a Gigabuck: Estimating GNU/Linux's Size</i></a>
and
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc"><i>Estimating Linux's Size</i></a>
to measure the SLOC of entire GNU/Linux distributions, and my essay
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/linux-kernel-cost.html">
Linux Kernel 2.6: It's Worth More!</a>
Others have
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~jgb/debian-counting">measured
Debian GNU/Linux</a> and the
<a href="http://www.etla.org/stdout/code/cpan_sloccount.html">Perl CPAN library</a>
using this tool suite.
SLOCCount runs on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Apple Mac OS X, Windows,
and hopefully on other systems too.
To run on Windows, you have to install
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">Cygwin</a> first
to create a Unix-like environment for SLOCCount
(Cygwin users: be sure to use ``Unix'' newlines, not ``DOS'' newlines,
when you install Cygwin).
<p>
<h1>Free and easy to use</h1>
<p>
SLOCCount is released under the General Public License (GPL), so you
can immediately download it -- at no cost! --
and you can modify it to suit your needs.
<p>
SLOCCount has a number of ease-of-use features.
You can easily install it, particularly on RPM-based
GNU/Linux systems.
For most situations, once it's installed all you need to do is type this
to measure all the code in a given directory (including its descendants):
<pre>
  sloccount <i>directoryname</i>
</pre>
<p>
SLOCCount can automatically identify and
measure the following languages (common extensions for the language are
listed in parentheses):
<ol>
<li>Ada (.ada, .ads, .adb)
<li>Assembly (.s, .S, .asm)
<li>awk (.awk)
<li>Bourne shell and variants (.sh)
<li>C (.c)
<li>C++  (.C, .cpp, .cxx, .cc)
<li>C shell (.csh)
<li>COBOL (.cob, .cbl) as of version 2.10
<li>C# (.cs) as of version 2.11
<li>Expect (.exp)
<li>Fortran (.f)
<li>Haskell (.hs) as of version 2.11
<li>Java (.java)
<li>lex/flex (.l)
<li>LISP/Scheme (.el, .scm, .lsp, .jl)
<li>Makefile (makefile) - not normally shown.
<li>Modula-3 (.m3, .i3) as of version 2.07
<li>Objective-C (.m)
<li>Pascal (.p, .pas)
<li>Perl (.pl, .pm, .perl)
<li>PHP (.php, .php[3456], .inc) as of version 2.05
<li>Python (.py)
<li>Ruby (.rb) as of version 2.09
<li>sed (.sed)
<li>SQL (.sql) - not normally shown.
<li>TCL (.tcl, .tk, .itk)
<li>Yacc/Bison (.y)
</ol>
<p>
SLOCCount includes a number of heuristics, so it can automatically
detect file types, even those that don't use the "standard" extensions, and
conversely, it can detect many files that have a standard
extension but aren't really of that type.
The SLOC counters have enough smarts to handle oddities of several
languages.
For example, SLOCCount examines assembly language files, determines
the comment scheme, and then correctly counts the lines automatically.
It also correctly handles language constructs that are often mishandled by
other tools, such as Python's constant strings when used as comments
and Perl's "perlpod" documentation.
<p>
SLOCCount will even automatically estimate the effort, time, and money
it would take to
develop the software (if it was developed as traditional proprietary software).
Without options, it will use the basic COCOMO model, which makes these
estimates solely from the count of lines of code.
You can get better estimates if you have more information about the project;
see the SLOCCount documentation for
<a href="sloccount.html#cocomo">information on how
to control the estimation formulas used in SLOCCount</a>.
<p>
SLOCCount comes with <a href="sloccount.html">extensive documentation</a> - you
should be able to just pick it up and use it.
<p>
<h1>Testimonials</h1>
<p>
I've received many nice comments about SLOCCount.  Here are some:
<ul>
<li>
"SLOCCount allows me to easily and
quickly quantify the source lines of code and variety in languages.
Even though these are just two fairly basic aspects of a project, it
helps a lot to get a first impression of the size and complexity of
projects." -- Auke Jilderda, Philips Research.
<li>
"Thanks for creating it. good work."
-- David Neiss, Qualcomm.
<li>
"SLOCCount has really helped us a lot in our studies on libre software
engineering"
-- Jesus M. Gonzalez Barahona, Grupo de Sistemas y Comunicaciones,
ESCET, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.
<!--
<li>
Although most users will never need to take advantage of it,
SLOCCount's intermediate work is recorded in a ".sloccount" directory.
This directory lets you check how good SLOCCount's heuristics are,
prompting this comment:
"I like the way you have done things. Using the .sloccount
directory of intermediate/cached data made debugging very easy."
- Randal Andress, Northrop Grumman Mission Systems.
-->
<li>
"Thanks for SLOCCount!  It's great...
We're using SLOCs derived from SLOCCount to
<a href="http://krang.sourceforge.net/docs/krang_vs_bric.html#complexity">
compare our software to the software it replaces</a> ...
Keep up the good work"
-- Sam Tregar
<li>
<!-- Publicly stated July 30, 2004, at
   http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/30/1229239&tid=145 -->
"Wow, using sloccount on the full
<a href="http://popfile.sf.net/">POPFile</a> source shows that developing
it would have cost around $500K in a regular software company.
That seems about right given the length of time we've been working
on it and the number of people involved. Cool tool."
-- John Graham Cumming
</ul>

organizational endorsements)
<p>
And of course, simple use is a great testament to its utility.
<a href="http://www.krugle.com">Krugle</a> uses sloccount
(<a href="http://www.krugle.com/kse/projects/9woJveD#2">here's an example</a>),
and I'm sure there are others.
Thanks to everyone who enjoys the tool!

<p>
SLOCCount is already packaged for Debian; you can just automatically
download and install SLOCCount using Debian's normal tools (such as apt-get).
You can see more information at the
<a href="http://packages.debian.org">web page on Debian packages</a>.
<p>
If you download the tar files, just follow the installation instructions
in the README file.
Let me head off one common email request:
If you get error messages like "break_filelist: command not found",
that means you didn't follow the installation directions.
SLOCCount is actually a suite of programs, and you must make sure that
your PATH environment variable includes the directory of the
SLOCCount executable programs.
That means you need to install the programs that your PATH variable
already includes, <i>or</i> you need to modify your PATH variable.
This is actually true for many programs, and isn't unique to
SLOCCount at all.

<h1>Current limitations</h1>
<p>
SLOCCount currently only measures physical SLOC, and not the
alternative logical SLOC.
Adding logical SLOC should not be too difficult, it's just that I didn't
need it for my purposes.
If anyone wishes to add that capability, please do so; I accept patches.
<p>
It can only provide estimates, and if you don't calibrate it, it will
use data from other programs that may or may not be representative.
<p>

Warning:
<a href="http://dilbert.com/fast/2003-08-26">there's more to a software program than just how many lines of code it has, as the August 26, 2003 Dilbert strip shows</a>.

<!-- http://web.archive.org/web/20030828234632/www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20030826.html

<!-- http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20030826.html -->

<p>
Some versions of perl cause a problem in
line 688 of break_filelist.
Fixing this isn't as simple as it should be.
If you replace:
<pre>
 open(FH, "-|", "md5sum", $filename) or return undef;
</pre>
with:
<pre>
 open(FH, "-|", "md5sum $filename") or return undef; 
</pre>
it will "work" but create a massive security vulnerability.
If the programs you analyze have nasty filenames like
"x;rm -fr $HOME", the creator of the program can make you run
arbitrary programs and cause bad things to happen
(in this example, erasing all your files).

<p>
<h1>Support and Maintenance</h1>
<p>
I have transitioned
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sloccount/">
SLOCCount maintenance and support to SourceForge.net</a>.
It has a mailing list for discussion of use and modification,
trackers for bugs and feature requests,
and a publicly-accessible software configuration management system
(using Subversion).
If you use the tool significantly (or think you might), or are interested
in making changes to it, please visit, join the mailing list, and
become a part of the community.

<h1>Related programs</h1>
I've learned of other programs that work with SLOCCount and do useful
things; you may want to look with them as well:
<ol>
<li>
Rasmus Toftdahl Olesen's
<a href="sloc2html.py">sloc2html</a>
<!-- rto, at pohldata.dk -->
takes the output of SLOCCount and turns it into HTML.
<a href="sloc2html-example.html">Here's an example of sloc2html output</a>.
I didn't write this code originally, but many
people have asked for it.
<a href="http://halfdans.net/index.py?p=sloc2html">sloc2html was
originally released here</a> but since disappeared from the Internet,
so I've had to recover a copy (and I made a few tweaks).
sloc2html is released under the GNU General Public License v. 2 or higher,
and requires Python to run (it's written in Python).
<p>
To use sloc2html, first run sloccount using
the --wide and --multiproject options, and store its results in a file.
Then run sloc2html, with that filename as its own argument.
Here's an example:
<pre>
    sloccount --wide --multiproject . &gt; result.txt
    sloc2html.py result.txt
</pre>
Be sure to use the same filename for sloc2html.py that you stored on your
system, and as always, make sure your PATH variable includes the
directory where the executables are stored.

<li><a href="http://mindx.josefspillner.de/kde/stats">SLOC Compare</a>
<!-- http://mindx.dyndns.org/kde/stats SLOC Compare -->
takes several sloccount output files (or several results stored in one file)
and visualizes the output, so you see changes over time.
The author, Josef Spillner, has used it to analyze KDE.

<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ossmole/">FLOSSmole (formerly OSSmole)</a>
is a set of tools for gathering data (metrics) about the development of free/libre/open source projects. "We also publish the resulting analyses about FLOSS projects, and accept data donations from other research groups!"

<li><a href="cloc.sourceforge.net">CLOC</a> counts SLOC, and includes some code from SLOCCount.

<li><a href="http://bcscr.sourceforge.net/">bcscr</a>
counts and compares lines of code in two directories
and reports lines changed, lines added, and lines deleted.
