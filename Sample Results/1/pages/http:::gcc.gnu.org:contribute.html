<h1>Contributing to GCC</h1>

<p>We strongly encourage individuals as well as organizations to
contribute to the development of GCC, in the form of new features, new
or improved optimizations, bug fixes, documentation updates, web page
improvements, etc....</p>

<p>There are certain legal requirements and style issues which all
contributions must meet:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#legal">Legal Prerequisites</a></li>
<li><a href="#standards">Coding Standards</a></li>
<li><a href="#testing">Testing Patches</a></li>
<li><a href="#docchanges">Documentation Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="#webchanges">Web Site Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="#patches">Submitting Patches</a></li>
<li><a href="#announce">Announcing Changes (to our Users)</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><a name="legal">Legal Prerequisites</a></h2>

<p>Before we can incorporate significant contributions, certain
legal requirements must be met.</p>

<p>The FSF prefers that a contributor files a copyright assignment for
large contributions.
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Legal-Matters">See
some documentation by the FSF</a> for details and contact us (either via
the <a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> list or the
GCC maintainer that is taking care of your contributions) to obtain
the relevant forms.  The most common forms are an assignment for a
specific change, an assignment for all future changes, and an employer
disclaimer, if an employer or school owns work created by the developer.
It's a good idea to send
<a href="mailto:assignments@gnu.org">assignments@gnu.org</a> a copy of
your request.</p>

<p>If a contributor is reluctant to sign a copyright assignment for a
change, a copyright disclaimer to put the change in the public domain is
acceptable as well.  The copyright disclaimer form is different than an
employer disclaimer form.  A copyright assignment is more convenient if a
contributor plans to make several separate contributions.</p>

<p>Small changes can be accepted without a copyright disclaimer or a
copyright assignment on file.</p>


<h2><a name="standards">Coding Standards</a></h2>

<p>All contributions must conform to the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
Standards</a>.  There are also some <a
href="codingconventions.html">additional coding conventions for
GCC</a>; these include documentation and testsuite requirements as
well as requirements on code formatting.</p>

<p>Submissions which do not conform to the standards will be returned
with a request to address any such problems.  To help with the
preparation of patches respecting these rules, one can use the script
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/trunk/contrib/check_GNU_style.sh">
contrib/check_GNU_style.sh</a> to detect some of the common
mistakes. </p>

<!-- also referenced from svnwrite.html -->
<h2><a name="testing">Testing Patches</a></h2>

<p>All patches must be thoroughly tested.  We encourage you to test
changes with as many host and target combinations as is practical.  In
addition to using real hardware, you can
<a href="simtest-howto.html">use simulators</a> to increase your test
coverage.</p>

<p>Much of GCC's code is used only by some targets, or used in quite
different ways by different targets.  When choosing targets to test a
patch with, make sure that your selections exercise all aspects of the
code you are changing.  For instance, a change to conditional branch
handling should be tested both with targets that use <code>cc0</code>,
and targets that don't.</p>

<p>You will of course have tested that your change does what you
expected it to do: fix a bug, improve an optimization, add a new
feature.  If the test framework permits, you should automate these
tests and add them to GCC's testsuite.  You must also perform
regression tests to ensure that your patch does not break anything
else.  Typically, this means comparing post-patch test results to
pre-patch results by testing twice or comparing with recent posts to
the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">gcc-testresults
list</a>.</p>

<h3>Which tests to perform</h3>

<p>If your change is to code that is not in a front end, or is to the
C front end, you must perform a complete build of GCC and the runtime
libraries included with it, on at least one target.  You must
bootstrap all default languages, not just C.  You must also run all of the
testsuites included with GCC and its runtime libraries.  For a normal
native configuration, running</p>
<blockquote><pre>
make bootstrap
make -k check
</pre></blockquote>
<p>from the top level of the GCC tree (<strong>not</strong> the
<code>gcc</code> subdirectory) will accomplish this.</p>

<p>If your change is to the C++ front end, you should rebuild the compiler,
<code>libstdc++</code>, <code>libjava</code> and run the C++ testsuite.
If you already did a complete C,C++,Java bootstrap from your build
directory before, you can use the following:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
make clean-target-libstdc++-v3                    # clean libstdc++ and ...
test -d */libjava &amp;&amp; make -C */libjava clean-nat  # ... parts of libjava
make all-target-libstdc++-v3 all-target-libjava   # rebuild compiler and libraries
make -k check-c++                                 # run C++/libstdc++ testsuite
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If your change is to a front end other than the C or C++ front end,
or a runtime library other than <code>libgcc</code>, you need to verify
only that the runtime library for that language still builds and the
tests for that language have not regressed.  (Most languages have
tests stored both in the <code>gcc</code> subdirectory, and in the
directory for the runtime library.)  You need not bootstrap, or test
other languages, since there is no way you could have affected
them.</p>

<p>Since the Ada front end is written in Ada, if you change it you
must perform a complete bootstrap; however, running other language
testsuites is not necessary.</p>

<p>In all cases you must test exactly the change that you intend to
submit; it's not good enough to test an earlier variant.  The tree
where you perform this test should not have any other changes applied
to it, because otherwise you cannot be sure that your patch will work
correctly on its own.  Include all your new testcases in your
testsuite run.</p>


<h2><a name="docchanges">Documentation Changes</a></h2>

<p>Documentation changes do not require a new bootstrap (a working
bootstrap is necessary to get the build environment correct), but you
must perform <code>make info</code> and <code>make dvi</code> and correct
any errors.  You should investigate complaints about overfull or
underfull hboxes from <code>make dvi</code>, as these can be the only
indication of serious markup problems, but do not feel obliged to
eliminate them all.</p>


<h2><a name="webchanges">Web Site Changes</a></h2>

<p>Changes to the web site must
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validate</a> as XHTML 1.0
Transitional.  The web pages as checked into CVS do not include
DOCTYPE declarations; they are automatically added when the web server
checks out its copy.  To validate your changes, temporarily insert
this header in place of the &lt;html&gt; tag, then use the "upload
file" mode of the validator.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html 
          PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Please mark patches with the tag [wwwdocs] in the subject line.</p>

<p>Web site sources are <a href="cvs.html">in CVS</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="patches">Submitting Patches</a></h2>

<p>Every patch must have several pieces of information, <em>before</em> we
can properly evaluate it:</p>

<dl>

<dt>A description of the problem/bug and how your patch addresses it.</dt>
<dd>
For new features a description of the feature and your implementation.
For bugs a description of what was wrong with the existing code, and a
reference to any previous bug report (in the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/">GCC bug tracking system</a> or the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/">gcc-bugs archives</a>) and any
existing testcases for the problem in the GCC testsuite.
</dd>

<dt>Testcases</dt>
<dd>
If you cannot follow the recommendations of the <a
href="codingconventions.html">GCC coding conventions</a> about
testcases, you should include a justification for why adequate
testcases cannot be added.
</dd>

<dt>ChangeLog</dt>
<dd>
A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files for
format and content, and the <a href="codingconventions.html">GCC
coding conventions</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
Standards</a> for further information.  The ChangeLog entries should
be plaintext rather than part of the patch since the top of the
ChangeLog changes rapidly and a patch to the ChangeLog would probably
no longer apply by the time your patch is reviewed.
If your change fixes a PR, put text in the ChangeLog entry mentioning
the PR.  The <code>svn commit</code> machinery understands how to
extract this information and automatically append the commit log to
the PR.  In order to be recognized, the text must fit a particular
form.  It must start with "PR", and then must include the category
and PR number.  For instance, <code>PR java/2369</code> is
valid.  Multiple PRs can be mentioned in a single message.
</dd>

<dt>Bootstrapping and testing</dt>
<dd>
State the host and target combinations you used to do <a
href="#testing">proper testing</a> as described above, and the results
of your testing.
</dd>

<dt>The patch itself</dt>
<dd>
If you are accessing the <a href="svn.html">SVN repository</a> at
gcc.gnu.org, please configure your svn to use GNU diff
and generate patches using the &quot;<code>-up</code>&quot; or 
&quot;<code>-cp</code>&quot; options.
See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SvnSetup">SVN setup instructions</a>
for more details.<br />
Do not include generated files as part of the patch, just mention
them in the ChangeLog (e.g., "* configure: Regenerate."). 
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Don't mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
<em>individually</em>.  Ideally, each change you send should be
impossible to subdivide into parts that we might want to consider
separately, because each of its parts gets its motivation from the
other parts.  In particular, changes to code formatting to conform to
coding standards are best not mixed with substantive changes, because
that makes it difficult to see what the real changes are.  (In the
case of a very large reorganization of code, it may make sense to
separate changes even further to make it clearer what has changed; for
example, by first sending structural changes that make subsequent
changes easier but do not change GCC's behavior, then new code, then
the changes that actually make use of the new code and change GCC's
behavior.)</p>

<p>We prefer patches posted as plain text or as MIME parts of type
<code>text/x-patch</code> or <code>text/plain</code>, disposition
<code>inline</code>, encoded as <code>7bit</code> or
<code>8bit</code>.
It is strongly discouraged to post patches as MIME parts of type
<code>application/</code><i>whatever</i>, disposition
<code>attachment</code> or encoded as <code>base64</code> or
<code>quoted-printable</code>.  Avoid MIME large-message splitting
(<code>message/partial</code>) at all costs.</p>

<p> If the patch is too big or too mechanical, posting it gzipped or
bzip2ed and uuencoded or encoded as a <code>base64</code> MIME part is
acceptable, as long as the ChangeLog is still posted as plain text.
</p>

<p>When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message and
send it to <a href="lists.html">the appropriate mailing list(s)</a>.
(Patches will go to one or more lists depending on what you are
changing.)  For further information on the GCC SVN repository, see
the <a href="svn.html">Anonymous read-only SVN access</a> and <a
href="svnwrite.html">Read-write SVN access</a> pages.</p>

<p>(Everything listed here still applies if you can check in the patch
without further approval under the <a
href="svnwrite.html#policies">GCC write access policies</a>, except
that ChangeLog entries may be included as part of the patch and diffs
representing new files may be omitted, especially if large, since they
can be accessed directly from the repository.)</p> 

<h3>Pinging patches, Getting patches applied</h3>

<p>If you do not receive a response to a patch that you have submitted
within two weeks or so, it may be a good idea to chase it by sending a
follow-up email to the same list(s).  Patches can occasionally fall through
the cracks.  Please be sure to include a brief summary of the patch and the
URL of the entry in the mailing list archive of the original submission.</p>

<p>If you do not have write access and a patch of yours has been approved,
but not committed, please advise the approver of that fact.  You may want
to point out lack of write access in your initial submission, too.</p>
 

<h2><a name="announce">Announcing Changes (to our Users)</a></h2>

<p>Everything that requires a user to edit his Makefiles or his source code
is a good candidate for being mentioned in the release notes.</p>

<p>Larger accomplishments, either as part of a specific project, or long
term commitment, merit mention on the front page.  Examples include projects
like tree-ssa, new backends, major advances in optimization or standards
compliance.</p>

<p>The gcc-announce mailing list serves to announce new releases and changes
like frontends or backends being dropped.</p>
