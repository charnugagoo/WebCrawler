<H1>An Essay on Endian Order</H1><br>
<b>Copyright (C) Dr. William T. Verts, April 19, 1996</b><p>

Depending on which computing system you use, you will have to
consider the byte order in which multibyte numbers are stored,
particularly when you are writing those numbers to a file.
The two orders are called "Little Endian" and "Big Endian".<p>

<b>The Basics</b><br><br>

"Little Endian" means that the low-order byte of the number
is stored in memory at the lowest address, and the high-order
byte at the highest address.  (The little end comes first.)
For example, a 4 byte LongInt
<PRE>
    Byte3 Byte2 Byte1 Byte0
</PRE>
will be arranged in memory as follows:
<PRE>
    Base Address+0   Byte0
    Base Address+1   Byte1
    Base Address+2   Byte2
    Base Address+3   Byte3
</PRE>
Intel processors (those used in PC's) use "Little Endian" byte order.<p>

"Big Endian" means that the high-order byte of the number is
stored in memory at the lowest address, and the low-order
byte at the highest address.  (The big end comes first.)
Our LongInt, would then be
stored as:
<PRE>
    Base Address+0   Byte3
    Base Address+1   Byte2
    Base Address+2   Byte1
    Base Address+3   Byte0
</PRE>
Motorola processors (those used in Mac's) use "Big Endian" byte order.<p>

<b>Which is Better?</b><br><br>

You may see a lot of discussion about the relative merits of the
two formats, mostly religious arguments based on the relative
merits of the PC versus the Mac.  Both formats have their
advantages and disadvantages.<p>

In "Little Endian" form,
assembly language instructions for picking up a 1, 2, 4, or
longer byte number proceed in exactly the same way for all
formats: first pick up the lowest order byte at offset 0.
Also, because of the 1:1 relationship between address offset
and byte number (offset 0 is byte 0), multiple precision
math routines are correspondingly easy to write.<p>

In "Big Endian" form, by having the high-order byte come
first, you can always test whether the number is positive
or negative by looking at the byte at offset zero.  You don't
have to know how long the number is, nor do you have to skip
over any bytes to find the byte containing the sign information.
The numbers are also stored in the order in which they are
printed out, so binary to decimal routines are particularly
efficient.<p>

<b>What does that Mean for Us?</b><br><br>

What endian order means is that any time
numbers are written to a file, you have to know how the file
is supposed to be constructed.  If you write out a graphics
file (such as a .BMP file) on a machine with "Big Endian"
integers, you must first reverse the byte order, or a "standard"
program to read your file won't work.<p>

The Windows .BMP format, since it was developed on a "Little
Endian" architecture, insists on the "Little Endian" format.
You must write your Save_BMP code this way, regardless of
the platform you are using.<p>

Common file formats and their endian order are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Adobe Photoshop</b> -- Big Endian
<li><b>BMP (Windows and OS/2 Bitmaps)</b> -- Little Endian
<li><b>DXF (AutoCad)</b> -- Variable
<li><b>GIF</b> -- Little Endian
<li><b>IMG (GEM Raster)</b> -- Big Endian
<li><b>JPEG</b> -- Big Endian
<li><b>FLI (Autodesk Animator)</b> -- Little Endian
<li><b>MacPaint</b> -- Big Endian
<li><b>PCX (PC Paintbrush)</b> -- Little Endian
<li><b>PostScript</b> -- Not Applicable (text!)
<li><b>POV (Persistence of Vision ray-tracer)</b> -- Not Applicable (text!)
<li><b>QTM (Quicktime Movies)</b> -- Little Endian (on a Mac!)
<li><b>Microsoft RIFF (.WAV & .AVI)</b> -- Both
<li><b>Microsoft RTF (Rich Text Format)</b> -- Little Endian
<li><b>SGI (Silicon Graphics)</b> -- Big Endian
<li><b>Sun Raster</b> -- Big Endian
<li><b>TGA (Targa)</b> -- Little Endian
<li><b>TIFF</b> -- Both, Endian identifier encoded into file
<li><b>WPG (WordPerfect Graphics Metafile)</b> -- Big Endian (on a PC!)
<li><b>XWD (X Window Dump)</b> -- Both, Endian identifier encoded into file
</ul>

<b>Correcting for the Non-Native Order</b><br><br>

It is pretty easy to reverse a multibyte integer if you find you
need the other format.  A single function can be used to switch
from one to the other, in either direction.  A simple and not
very efficient version might look as follows:
<XMP>
    Function Reverse (N:LongInt) : LongInt ;
     Var B0, B1, B2, B3 : Byte ;
    Begin
        B0 := N Mod 256 ;
        N  := N Div 256 ;
        B1 := N Mod 256 ;
        N  := N Div 256 ;
        B2 := N Mod 256 ;
        N  := N Div 256 ;
        B3 := N Mod 256 ;
        Reverse := (((B0 * 256 + B1) * 256 + B2) * 256 + B3) ;
    End ;
</XMP>

A more efficient version that depends on the presence of 
hexadecimal numbers, bit masking
operators AND, OR, and NOT, and shift operators SHL and SHR might
look as follows:
<XMP>
    Function Reverse (N:LongInt) : LongInt ;
     Var B0, B1, B2, B3 : Byte ;
    Begin
        B0 := (N AND $000000FF) SHR  0 ;
        B1 := (N AND $0000FF00) SHR  8 ;
        B2 := (N AND $00FF0000) SHR 16 ;
        B3 := (N AND $FF000000) SHR 24 ;
        Reverse := (B0 SHL 24) OR (B1 SHL 16) OR (B2 SHL 8) OR (B3 SHL 0) ;
    End ;
</XMP>

There are certainly more efficient methods, some of which are quite
machine and platform dependent.  Use what works best.<p>
